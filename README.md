# Mobile-Controlled-Robotic-Arm-
This is an arduino project featuring a robotic arm. It can be controlled by a mobile application, manually, joystick or potentiometer. I made this robotic arm to be used with a obstacle avoidance car, and pick up objects. This robotic arm has 3D printed hardware and four servo motors working together to ensure four levels of freedom.

The pieces of this robotic arm can be 3D printed from this link: https://grabcad.com/library/acrylic-robot-4-dof-robot-mechanical-arm-1
I also encountered six servo versions of the same robot, the code is essentially the same. If you would like to work with a six servo model instead, open the manual control code and change the movement degrees to a smaller value to see which servo controls which motion type. Then, copy and paste the "servo movement blocks" two more times and repeat the process. Then, after the manual control code works well, you can proceed to edit the mobile application, joystick and potentiometer codes.
